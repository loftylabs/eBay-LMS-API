The lmslib is a python module that builds eBay Large Merchant Services
API call requests( xml strings) and has the functionality to send
them to the correct eBay server endpoint as well as receive and parse
the response files.

It is already expected that you know what the eBay Large Merchant Services is
and what they're expecting, but this module does all the hard stuff for you.

In order to begin connecting to eBay's API servers you must have already created
a developer account on their website (https://www.x.com/developers/ebay) and
obtained developer credentials( developer key, application key, certificate key)
as well as generated an auth token.

There are two different environments that eBay uses: the production environment, which
is their live server; and the sandbox environment, which is used for testing and
doesn't involve any transfer of money or goods. It is recommended that you test
everything on the sandbox first before deciding to go live with it.

The two different environments also take different credential information, which
you'll have to generate yourself, from the account settings of your eBay developer
account.

In order for lmslib module to begin connecting to eBay servers as your account,
you must supply your credentials to the module.  This information is stored in 
two seperate JSON files:
	credentials.json( Your credentials for the production server)
	sb_credentials.json( Your credentials for the sandbox server)
Simply open those files in your favorite text editor and put your credentials in the
proper spots.


An example of how to use the API can be found in the examples/ directory. 
The file api_test.py goes through every step of the LMS lifecycle that is 
necessary to upload a BulkDataFile that contains multiple Trading API requests,
and have eBay process the data, and send back a response detailing what happened
to each request( whether they Succeeded or Failed)

Please use the Sandbox environment for testing your knowledge and understanding
of both eBay's Large Merchant Services and the lmslib module.
